            <header>Here's a timeline of Elon Musk's Life:</header>

            <ul>
              <li>
                <b>1971</b> - June 28th, Elon musk is born in Pretoria, South Africa.
              </li>

              <li>
                1981 - Musk developed an interest in computers and taught himself how to program.
              </li>

              <li>
                1983 - he sold his first software: a game he created called Blastar for around $500.
              </li>

              <li>
                1986 - He went through a growth spurt and learned how to defend himself with karate and wrestling.
              </li>

              <li>
                1989 - Musk moved to Canada to attend Queen’s University. Musk obtained his Canadian citizenship that year, in part because he felt it would be easier to obtain American citizenship via that path.
              </li>

              <li>
                1992 - Musk left Canada to study business and physics at the University of Pennsylvania. He graduated with an undergraduate degree in economics and stayed for a second bachelor’s degree in physics.
              </li>

              <li>
                1995 - After leaving Pennsylvania, Musk headed to Stanford University in California to pursue a PhD in energy physics. However, his move was timed perfectly with the Internet boom, and he dropped out of Stanford after just two days to become a part of it, launching his first company, Zip2 Corporation; which he later sold for $307 million in cash and $34 million in stock options.
              </li>

              <li>
                1999 - Elon and Kimbal Musk used the money from their sale of Zip2 to found X.com, an online financial services/payments company. An X.com acquisition the following year led to the creation of PayPal as it is known today.
              </li>

              <li>
                2002 - Musk earned his first billion when PayPal was acquired by eBay for $1.5 billion in stock. Before the sale, Musk owned 11 percent of PayPal stock. In the same year, Musk founded his third company SpaceX, with the intention of building spacecraft for commercial space travel.
              </li>

              <li>
                2008 - SpaceX was well established, and NASA awarded the company the contract to handle cargo transport for the International Space Station—with plans for astronaut transport in the future—in a move to replace NASA’s own space shuttle missions.
              </li>

              <li>
                2012 - Musk and SpaceX made history when the company launched its Falcon 9 rocket into space with an unmanned capsule. The vehicle was sent to the International Space Station with 1,000 pounds of supplies for the astronauts stationed there, marking the first time a private company had sent a spacecraft to the International Space Station. Of the launch, Musk was quoted as saying, "I feel very lucky. ... For us, it's like winning the Super Bowl."
              </li>

              <li>
                 2013 - a Falcon 9 successfully carried a satellite to geosynchronous transfer orbit, a distance at which the satellite would lock into an orbital path that matched the Earth's rotation. In February 2015, SpaceX launched another Falcon 9 fitted with the Deep Space Climate Observatory (DSCOVR) satellite, aiming to observe the extreme emissions from the sun that affect power grids and communications systems on Earth.
              </li>

              <li>
                2017 - SpaceX saw the successful test flight and landing of a Falcon 9 rocket made from reusable parts, a development that opened the door for more affordable space travel. A setback came later that year, when an explosion occurred during a test of the company's new Block 5 Merlin engine. SpaceX reported that no one was hurt, and that the issue would not hamper its planned rollout of a future generation of Falcon 9 rockets.<br>
                Musk presented an updated design plan for his BFR (an acronym for either "Big F---ing Rocket" or "Big Falcon Rocket"), a 31-engine behemoth topped by a spaceship capable of carrying at least 100 people. He revealed that SpaceX was aiming to launch the first cargo missions to Mars with the vehicle in 2022, as part of his overarching goal of colonizing the Red Planet.
              </li>

              <li>
                2018 - The company enjoyed another milestone moment in with the successful test launch of the powerful Falcon Heavy rocket. Armed with additional Falcon 9 boosters, the Falcon Heavy was designed to carry immense payloads into orbit and potentially serve as a vessel for deep space missions. For the test launch, the Falcon Heavy was given a payload of Musk's cherry-red Tesla Roadster, equipped with cameras to "provide some epic views" for the vehicle's planned orbit around the sun.<br>
                Later in the year, Space X enjoyed the successful landing of a new Block 5 Falcon rocket, which touched down on a drone ship less than 9 minutes after liftoff.<br>
                2018, SpaceX received permission from the U.S. government to launch a fleet of satellites into low orbit for the purpose of providing Internet service. The satellite network, named Starlink, would ideally make broadband service more accessible in rural areas, while also boosting competition in heavily populated markets that are typically dominated by one or two providers. 
              </li>

              <li>
                2019 - SpaceX launched the first batch of 60 satellites and followed with another payload of 60 satellites that November. While this represented significant progress for the Starlink venture, the appearance of these bright orbiters in the night sky, with the potential of thousands more to come, worried astronomers who felt that a proliferation of satellites would increase the difficulty of studying distant objects in space.
              </li>

              <li>
                2003 - Musk is the co-founder, CEO and product architect at Tesla Motors, a company dedicated to producing affordable, mass-market electric cars as well as battery products and solar roofs. Musk oversees all product development, engineering and design of the company's products.
              </li>

              <li>
                2008 - Tesla unveiled the Roadster, a sports car capable of accelerating from 0 to 60 mph in 3.7 seconds, as well as traveling nearly 250 miles between charges of its lithium ion battery.<br>
                With a stake in the company taken by Daimler and a strategic partnership with Toyota, Tesla Motors launched its initial public offering in June 2010, raising $226 million.<br>
                Tesla announced plans for its Model S, the company's first electric sedan that was reportedly meant to take on the BMW 5 series. 
              </li>

              <li>
                2012 - the Model S finally entered production at a starting price of $58,570. Capable of covering 265 miles between charges,
              </li>

              <li>
                2017 - Tesla announced that it surpassed General Motors to become the most valuable U.S. car maker. The news was an obvious boon to Tesla, which was looking to ramp up production and release its Model 3 sedan later that year.
              </li>

              <li>
                2019 - using what Musk described as a "Plaid powertrain," a Model S set a speed record for four-door sedan at Laguna Seca Raceway in Monterey County, California
              </li>
              
              <li>
                2022 - Musk officially bought Twitter and became the social media company's CEO.
